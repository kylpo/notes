# Good Netizens Are Bloggers
Good netizens blog about their findings. This helps increase SEO and signal boost good ideas that are out there. The more popular ones rise to the top.

Thought about this from reading https://android.jlelse.eu/android-tools-attributes-listitem-sample-data-rocks-bbf49aaa9f07, which boosted a video that I really benefitted from watching.

While some will say, why are so many people talking and contributing to a pool of knowledge that already exists, I say it is almost like we are our own newspapers. When a breakthrough article comes out in Science journal, I don't know about it. But when media picks up the story and talks about it all week, I become aware. Now, what if it was just one media outlet, would I care to risk my precious time on what is the equivalent of an Amazon 5 star, 1 rating? Probably not.

# Good Netizens Are Reviewers
Similar reasons to blogging. Just note that no matter the rating system, you should probably just think in terms of "do
I recommend? Or do I not?". Because, really, if something is 3 stars, we don't go for it. Nowadays things need to be
4.5+ for us to consider trying.
