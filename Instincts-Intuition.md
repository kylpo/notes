The value in going deep on learning something is not that you will remember everything, it is that it'll hone your instincts. You won't know exactly why something doesn't seem right, but you'll be able to reason about it and provide a fix.

Experience is all about instincts

Good designers have a feeling towards good design. For example, reducing the text on in a section, reducing the image clutter in a section.

Same with coders. Instincts on how to shape code, simplify the complex, etc. In particular, it helps with debugging and understanding more than just something working because it does, it is "magic", and breaking when it doesn't... just... work.


Intuition frees you from always needing to know the `why`. I do recommend you keep the `why` tucked away in notes that you can easily access though.
