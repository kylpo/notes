# Lists
Lists look SO nice and clean for items that have the exact same layout. Seems like the convention lately is to open
detail view on click instead of expanding a row, like contacts used to do:

Question for lists: should there be a line between items? Should they live in a card and expand to their own card, like
Inbox?

Contacts is now a bit all over the board with cards in places they should use lists.
