# Quick thoughts on Daydream

Love the idea of no-cable. Also thought it'd be fun to use my wireless earbuds with this wireless headset.

Did feel a bit nauseous. Not the type that would ever lead to puking, just felt a bit uncomfortable and headachey.

Seeing pixels sucks. Gotta be higher resolution to truly feel immersive.

Content out there is trying hard, but when all you have is a clumsy pointer that frequently needs to be re-centered, there's not much you can build.

Best game experience I felt was the vr clans game. But after playing for 30 mins and wanting to take off the head gear, I realized this whole experience could've worked just fine on laptop, tablet, etc. Especially because all you really do is pan your head around (not even looking behind you), and use the mouse to select and drop things. But it was frustrating to try to grab something and not be able to pick it up because the pointer isn't as accurate as your finger or a mouse.
