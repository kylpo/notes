# The test:
Header using Text's union string prop
- can it add to the union?

## Typescript
- works perfectly except intellisense in string of inherited prop. Suggests nothing. Properly intellisenses prop and string vals at prop level though.
  - `interface IProps extends HeadaerProps {}`

# Types in general
- [Patrick Stapfer on Twitter: "First super simple example I tried... From left to right #TypeScript -> #Flow -> #ReasonML ... I prefer 100% over 80% in my type system https://t.co/lVMvRMXBmX"](https://twitter.com/ryyppy/status/869208354371010560)
  - [Sven SAULEAU on Twitter: "@ryyppy wow TIL: TypeScript has no inference whatsoever. ðŸ‘‡is completely fine since implicit any. https://t.co/ohOiZZAUtM"](https://twitter.com/svensauleau/status/869211688746274817)
  - [Roman Zanettin ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ on Twitter: "@ryyppy @Jakeherringbone @svensauleau that's what make me happy and confident in TS. do not rely on inference and know that i have to type 100% to get the best result ðŸ˜Š"](https://twitter.com/roman_zanettin/status/869279235621494784)
- [Roman Liutikov on Twitter: "@svensauleau It's about type inference like in OCaml and writing types everywhere in Java."](https://twitter.com/roman01la/status/863727468276047873)
  - [Sven SAULEAU on Twitter: "@roman01la Yes I see, Java is aware of this and recently added very limited type inference https://t.co/BNRMuFh2PE"](https://twitter.com/svensauleau/status/863729233415294977)

# Type Inference
- "Type inference doesn't mean code is unreadable. The opposite. It means *everything* becomes readable, not just the manually annotated code!" - [@jordwalke](https://twitter.com/jordwalke/status/874525331171848192)
