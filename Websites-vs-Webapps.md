_WIP_

Let's standardize a Website's characteristics:
- Best thought of as a living or static document
- Annotation standard applies
  - [Perspectives on Annotation - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2cJNDs7y2Y)
  - "Robust Anchor Links" to link to more than just headers
- Clickable headers for anchor links required (like github's markdown, not like Medium)
  - I think I could feel complete with the purpose of my life if I was able to get all websites to anchor link their headers.
  - [example](https://developer.android.com/training/gestures/scale.html#pan) of frustrating experience where anchor links exist, but not discovered by clicking on the Header:
- `h1`, `h2`, etc make sense and are relevant
  - same with `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, etc

Let's standardize a Webapp's characteristics:
- Best thought of as scenes/screens instead of documents

# App vs Site
App has LHS "app-tabs" bar http://collectui.com/designers/pijusgraphics/monitoring-dashboard

Site has top tab bar

Kind of a joke, but also partly true.
