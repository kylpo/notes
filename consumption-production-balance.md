# Consumption/Production Balance
With so much new, evolving information in the world, it is not reasonable to expect that you can learn and retain it all. Instead, focus only on content that you are truly interested in and/or your direct community finds relevant (or a community that you would like to some day be a part of).

e.g. If robotics interested me, but none of my friends would join me, only really research it if I would enjoy it alone, or if I would soon seek out new friends to share the interest with. This is an actionable task though, only research it when you intend to make those new friends - never for the "just in case".

Limit consumption in favor of production. When you are producing, youâ€™ll likely consume what you need when you run into the problem.
