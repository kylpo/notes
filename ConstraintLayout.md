# I am fascinated with ConstraintLayout

Works wonderfully for WYSIWYGs. Makes for some pretty lousy XML though (many props, with long names).

## ML
ConstraintLayout (and ConstraintSet) works well in WYSIYG editors because it is flat and allows movement/placement of any child. This quality makes it a viable candidate for ML-generated code from images. Pretty intriguing that all UI could be ML stitched together. Devs would help handle the events and data.
