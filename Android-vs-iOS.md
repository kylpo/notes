# Lock in
Android allows replacing browser, keyboard, messenger, etc.

iOS is locked in to Safari, iMessage, etc.

> This infuriates me!

iOS is starting to open up a bit more though. The keyboard is now replacable.

# Widgets
Android widgets live on desktop screens. I.e. it is glancable in your launcher/dashboard.

iOS widgets exist in Today section of Notification Center. It has a designated area, not necessarily glancable.

# Lock Screen Widgets
Android used to have this. No more. From v4.2 - 4.4. See [DashClock Widget \- Android Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock) for an example.

# Tablet
Android tablets are essentially non-existant at this point. Chromebooks are taking their place though.

iPad just received a surge of new hype from the recent OS.

# Notifications
Actionable?

# Screen Saver
Android: formerly Daydream, now called "Screen Saver". Can be enabled when plugged in and/or docked.

# Share

# Quick Settings

# Navigation
Android's back button is vastly supperior to iOS's top-left back buttons, imo.

# Windowing
## Split Windows
Android:
- [Multi\-Window Support \| Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window.html#overview)
- Android has this on phones, but I basically never use it.

iOS:
- iPad only

## Floating Windows
Android:
- [Supported](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Window.html#isFloating()): app can float over other apps

    - [Quick Swipe \- Android Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quickswipe)
- Also supports `freeform` with Developer option enabled.
    - freeform enables all apps to be launched as floating and resizable, just like our desktop windows
    - [Taskbar \- Android Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farmerbb.taskbar&rdid=com.farmerbb.taskbar) even provides a Windows-like start menu and Taskbar. Could be amazing with tablets + keyboard + mouse, as it also offers keyboard hotkeys.

- `pip` supported

Widget essentially pins to desktop. Float let's it float over apps. Default state of app is full screen (or 100% x 100%). Split mode just adds another full app and allows user to change the line that they stretch to.

iOS:
- only `pip` supported

## Lock Window
Android:
- Screen Pinning ([Android 5\.0 APIs \| Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html#ScreenPinning)) allows a user to "pin" current app to the front to prevent access to the rest of the OS. Only that app is usable until it is unpinned (hold Back + Overview). When unpinned, user is first set back to lock screen.
    - Note: this is different from kiosk mode.

# Multi-user
Android:
- Supported on tablets - [Android 4\.2 APIs \| Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.2.html#MultipleUsers)

iOS:
- Not supported (iPad is designed to be a single-user device)

# Launcher
