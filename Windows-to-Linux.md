# Windows 10 Font woes
Some fonts look really, really terrible in Chrome, like Calibri.

There is a system-wide setting to help font rendering called ClearType. This was enabled already, and disabling does nothing for Chrome. I learned ClearType only affects the old win32-based apps. Does not affect Store, Edge, or other UWP apps.

Edge looks great, because it is UWP. Also doesn't have the extensions I want. Bummmmer!

Of course, MacOS and Linux (ChromeOS, too) don't suffer from this.

This whole ordeal almost made me switch to Ubuntu....
