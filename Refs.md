- callbacks, how to avoid boilerplate? called on when unmounted (passes null)?
- how to reduce boilerplate with something like https://github.com/fresk-nc/babel-plugin-transform-jsx-ref-to-function?
- wish I could have a `setRef` prop that just accepts a pointer to my instance field.
- You may not use the ref attribute on functional components because they don't have instances. https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#refs-and-functional-components
