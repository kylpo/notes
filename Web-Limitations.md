_WIP_

# Transitions/Animations
- growing width/height and adjusting sibling content.
  - seen toggling filters at [apple.com](http://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all-accessories/whats-new)

# Oddities
- [Show 'Search' button in iPhone/iPad Safari keyboard](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4864167/show-search-button-in-iphone-ipad-safari-keyboard)
  - must wrap the `<input type='search' />` in a `<form>`
- Unable to prevent user zooming in Safari anymore. The claim is that it helps accessibility, which sounds great, but do they force their native apps to respond this way as well? No? Why!?

- Safari auto zooms-in form `input`s that have font less than 16px
