_WIP_

# size
- redux is tiny, but realistically, you'll need to add thunk/saga, immutable (60KB), and reselect, which sum up to a lot
- mobx is 53KB
- [Hassan Bazzi on Twitter: "A month of active development & still going strong thanks to #webpack code splitting & tiny libs (<3 @preactjs ). Now to get rid of Redux... https://t.co/da2Xh0bCW7"](https://twitter.com/habazzi/status/842285642444812288)

# Redux
- [jevakallio/redux-offline: Build Offline-First Apps for Web and React Native](https://github.com/jevakallio/redux-offline)
- ["Redux looks far more useful when viewed not as an app state management solution, but a protocol for different libraries to operate on state."](https://twitter.com/VilleImmonen/status/854335136900550656)
  - "Now tools made for Redux can be used with those libraries. Persist the state to disk? Got it. Transactions? Yup. Dev tools, logging? Check."
