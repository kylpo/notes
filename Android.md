# Why I'm falling in love with Android all over again
Recently, I've been researching OS platforms and their capabilites. Because I landed on MacOS as the best desktop and power user option, I thought I should give iOS another hard look. Also, not gonna lie, the ARKit is compelling. What I learned in my iOS vs Android is that Android is just so well positioned to continue dominance.

Floating windows, lapdock, etc. Termux, AIDE. mouse support.

I'd love to be able to go all-in on Android as an experiment. Just wish there were good android tablets. Also wish Google would make Android devleopment ON an Android device a first-class priority.

Give me an android "Surface"!!!!
