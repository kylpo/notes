"A new immersive mode lets apps use every pixel on the screen to show content and capture touch events."

# Storage Access
New in IOS 11, in android since Kitkat (https://developer.android.com/about/versions/kitkat.html#44-storage-access)

Not just local: it enables providers of cloud-based services.

# Keyboard/Hotkeys
## System keyboard key
Mac got this right with `super`. `copy`/`paste` are OS-level functions, so they belong with `super`.

Window's `win` button is similar. They messed up `ctrl c`/`ctrl v` for copy/paste though. Also, `alt-tab` to switch windows, `alt-f4` to close windows. None of those keybinds make sense compared to Mac.

## Simplified keyboard and cursor movement
Again, Mac totally nailed this. Many of us work on laptops today, using the laptop's keyboard. The mac's keyboard is as close to perfect as I can get. Because it has the system level `super` modifier (and emacs keybinds of `ctrl-a`, `ctrl-f`, etc) there is no need for a physical `Home`, `End`, `PgUp`, `PgDn` keys crammed into the layout.
