love that Android has Back and Home controls on bottom left, and Multitasker bottomr right when on tablets.

"I really wish they added mouse support in iOS 11. Itâ€™s very awkward to reach up to the screen to tap constantly or move your cursor around." - comment in [Google Docs has finally made working from my iPad possible \- The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16165336/google-docs-suggested-edits-ipad-work-game-changer)

love the hardware nav buttons on the dock, too. Nice touch.

Dock has a built-in fan! SO smart.

# Inputs
Progressive enhancement of inputs.

Touch, Stylus, Keyboard, Mouse, Trackpad.

Consider gestures, shortcuts, modes.

Everything-first for highest quality apps in any context.

Best to think about starting with mobile (and disabling app in non-touch contexts if you need, like [android on chromeos](https://developer.android.com/topic/arc/index.html#update-manifest))

Mouse, keyboard, and stylus are precision tools. Also more convenient than touching a screen oftentimes.


Cool idea from Preme for Windows: Scroll taskbar to adjust volume. Even better would be scrolling the sound icon, maybe? Also interesting is `esc` `esc` (`esc` twice) to close windows.

# Dock/Taskbar

# Virtual Desktops

# Events
Events broadcast to inform your app how to respond

## Ambient Mode
Not just for screen savers

Even Samsung Gear has it:

## Inputs
Everything input is first-class, and can accomplish most tasks. I.e. a keyboard shorcut should also be accomplished with a just a mouse, which should be accomplishable with just a touch/gesture.

Even Rotary Events? [Event Handling \| Tizen Developers](https://developer.tizen.org/zh-hans/development/training/web-application/understanding-tizen-programming/event-handling?langredirect=1)

# Windows/Views
## Full-screen **Immersive mode**
https://developer.android.com/about/versions/kitkat.html#44-immersive

![](https://developer.android.com/images/kk-immersive-n5.jpg)

"A new immersive mode lets apps use every pixel on the screen to show content and capture touch events."

# Storage Access
New in IOS 11, in android since Kitkat (https://developer.android.com/about/versions/kitkat.html#44-storage-access)

Not just local: it enables providers of cloud-based services.

# Keyboard/Hotkeys
## System keyboard key
Mac got this right with `super`. `copy`/`paste` are OS-level functions, so they belong with `super`.

Window's `win` button is similar. They messed up `ctrl c`/`ctrl v` for copy/paste though. Also, `alt-tab` to switch windows, `alt-f4` to close windows. None of those keybinds make sense compared to Mac.

## Simplified keyboard and cursor movement
Again, Mac totally nailed this. Many of us work on laptops today, using the laptop's keyboard. The mac's keyboard is as close to perfect as I can get. Because it has the system level `super` modifier (and emacs keybinds of `ctrl-a`, `ctrl-f`, etc) there is no need for a physical `Home`, `End`, `PgUp`, `PgDn` keys crammed into the layout.

## System touch gestures

# Widgets (also called Gadgets)
or, pinned mini-apps

## Glancable
Windows 8+ tiles. Functionality is pretty much worthless. More like a persistent text/image notification that you must click to understand further. Even worse though, if the News app shows a story you have interest in, it'll take you to the app. NOT to the story inside the app.

## Actionable
Has buttons and/or inputs, basically. Music player controls, sticky notes, to-do lists, etc.

True mini-apps. Likely take up more resources?
