# from vim to vscode
catalyst was showing off flow's autocompletion to a coworker. I said the only thing I'm really craving is a way to describe these values with jsdoc or something. He said "oh, cool, and does it give intellisense for the prop's value!?" - well, no, no it does. Why?

This sent me down the rabbit hole of Typescript again. TS does provide intellisense for values, AND you can add a descriptive comment.

main reason: intellisense
also, freedom to customize. I don't want to write an auto-tag close feature for vim. I can easily with ts and vscode though. And because it is ts, I will have intellisense to help me. Unlike atom's CoffeeScript or vim's vimscript.

vscode interates quickly, and in the open

vscode works _well_ on Windows. I'm considering a switch, and the smoother the transition, the better.

vscode format on save is great

vscode is like iphone hardware with ios. The tight integration makes for a wonderful, first-class typescript experience.

Things I will miss from vim: the details. Got my syntax highlighting exactly the way I wanted. Marker folding was great for hiding import statements.

vim is like Linux. Loved customizing it to be (almost) exactly what I wanted, but takes so much time to get it and keep it there. vsCode is like MacOS - sane defaults with fewer customizations and little - no maintenance cost.
