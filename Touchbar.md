"The Touch Bar, despite its name, is actually an Eye Bar."

[BrendanEich on Twitter: "Bailed back from 2016 MBP with tabstrip/soft\-ESC/crap\-keyboard back to 2015\. At this rate I'll be back on a Thinkpad with Linux in a year\."](https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/926186035179962368)

Pros:
- Better able to know what window is focussed
- exposes shortcuts you may've not thought about (app stores tabs can be changed with cmd+1-5, for example). Also, I never really care to remember these, so may as well use the touchbar and not the hotkeys.
- good for non-power users who don't rely on keyboard shortcuts as often
- shows what types of shortcuts are available in your specific context
  - https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/btt-android-studio-config for example of debugging vs run vs first open
- touchId is great
- Sliders are really nice. Basically the best thing to showcase  on the touchbar. For example, Keynote's opacity slider when selecting a Text input. I could see designers getting down on this feature.

Cons:
- Easy to accidentally tap a button when reaching for number keys or hitting delete (my pinky hits delete while my ring finger sometimes hits the volume capacitive button)
  - After using this for a week, this is definitely a deal break. I'm so often in the brightness and volume setting.
- why press this capacitive button (with no physical response that it is tapped) when you can use keyboard shortcuts?
  - especially painful when pressing esc
- on that same thought, this promotes looking at your fingers, which slows you down. There is a reason we prefer to touch-type and not peck at keys anymore.
- not many non-apple apps support custom keys
- Back to the good ol' issue of icons vs text. How do I know what this icon does? In-app, often i get to hover over it to see descriptive text.
- How to choose which actions to show. For example, in Keynote, when I edit text, it'll show the Style picker to change to Header, Sub-Header, etc. Why doesn't it show others like font, alignment, size, etc?
- Battery life seems affected
- No way for a website to modify touchbar
- Pausing music now always two taps away (open menu, play/pause)

Take pictures of how it adapts in Keynote, Safari in New Tab Page and watching a video like https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/708/. Also show the tab switcher that comes up when there are multiple tabs.

Summary:
I don't like or dislike this feature. I see it as being useful for some types of users and not for others. As a coder and hotkey "power user", I think I fall in to the group that does not find much use of this.

Does seem like all of the pros of touchbar would be accessible with a real touchscreen without the assiciated cons. Almost a slap in the face, really. :thinking_face:
