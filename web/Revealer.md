Treat the Revealer's role as you would an IDE's _timeline_. It doesn't tell things how to react, necessarily, it just tells them to react, and potentially monitors how long it takes them to fire tiggers afterward.

Like Canary's new Event Timeline: https://twitter.com/umaar/status/849610803368140800

```jsx
<Section
  id='myUniqueID'
  groupID=''
  waitForLazy={}
  waitForSection={}
  waitForGroup={}
  onEnter={}
  onLeave={}
>
  ...
</Section>
```

row-level animations?

How to check neighbors in view? `isLoaded` && `isVisible` => `isReady`

  - [react\-inview\-monitor Example](https://snipsco.github.io/react-inview-monitor/) - interesting idea to just apply the className, like `ReactCSSTransitionGroup`.
```jsx
return (
  <InViewMonitor
    intoViewRatioShownThreshold={0}
    classNameInitial='tabs'
    classNameScrolledPastView='tabs tabs--fixed'
  >
    <TabsHere />
  </InViewMonitor>
)
```
