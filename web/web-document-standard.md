## Linkable headers
Reading docs on Github has ruined me

I want every header to be linkable. Any webpage that could be considered an article SHOULD have a clickable header, which changes the url to set the anchor point for copy/pasting and sharing with others. 

Good examples include https://cloudfour.com/thinks/designing-responsive-progressive-web-apps/

Bad examples include Medium

Necessary for the web of sharable information.


## On a tangent, but should be in same post:
The custom blogs are now frustrating to me. I want to be able to +1 https://aerotwist.com/tutorials/protip-choose-your-ease/, but there is no option to promote it without something silly like a tweet.





----------------
I like that medium.com provides features like Kindle's reading features (popular highlights), comments in context, etc. If most writing was done on Medium, I think it might actually be a good thing.

I might decide to make kylpo.com just a landing page and purely blog on Medium.

No, because medium articles make for a great reading experience, but a kind of lousy one for helping people learn about me and my work or other posts.
