# Against it
- Template strings
  - ["UI string templates are regaining traction (iknowrite?). We should meme them back into Best Practices just so we can Rethink them again."](https://twitter.com/jordwalke/status/869312543562452993)
  - ["Right - each framework shipping a proprietary DSL for smearing JS into html attributes is something I hope to never deal with again."](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/869389964605362180)
  - ["Having to use re-invented scope and syntax instead of JavaScript, having to futz around to get stuff into scope and all scope-related magic"](https://twitter.com/jbscript/status/869397829407526912)
  - ["The output isn't the issue, it's the extra stuff that needs to be in your head to successfully write, debug and understand the template"](https://twitter.com/jbscript/status/869405002711785472)
  - [Daniel Steigerwald on Twitter: "@ryanflorence The point of components over templates isn't the state but composable debuggable code, not HTML string black boxy tag soup."](https://twitter.com/steida/status/746464098527944705)
  - [Ryan Florence on Twitter: "If you're really into everything being stateless "Dumb Components", you might have a look at templating libs instead of React."](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/746399922723819520)
