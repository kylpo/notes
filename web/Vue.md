Vue is nice for its 'single file components'

Vue vs React

Vue: do you want to write document in what is essentially html, with 3 key sections (template, script, style). I imagine I'd need to jump around the single-file components quite a bit. From template tag/classname to style. From template data to script data. Also need to parse template dsl if going the way of string templates. Also think about a decomposition refactor, and how much code would need to be cut/pasted.

React: or as js (via jsx) and not really need to jump around at all (with style props).

One pro of Vue is making templates a first-class concern for perf though. I wouldn't need to write shouldComponentUpdate()s.

I would also think that a WYSIWYG editor might have an easier job of thinking about components in this way: template, style, script. Thought about this when reading through Android's docs on XML layout. They're able to make a designer view because it is made up of XML.
