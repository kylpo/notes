# Ads too far
Wow, I never really thought ads were a problem until I saw this page: https://www.phonearena.com/news/How-to-run-several-apps-in-floating-windows-in-Android-7.0-Nougat-no-root_id84549. This, is terrible, and not something I want to support.

Ads are so bad now. It makes me an AMP believer.

## Against it

> Unless you run a News site that HAS to compete for a spot in Google Carousel enabling AMP is not worth the effort. AMP is an alternative publishing format and most small site can‚Äôt afford to maintain two (quality) versions of itself.

AMP has already won. This screenshot taken from my Google Feed in July 2017.

And by creating this strict, statically laid out environment, it enables platforms such as Google Search to get one step closer to ‚Äúinstant‚Äù by preloading just the first viewport.

To make the experience reliably fast, you need to live with some constraints when implementing AMP pages. AMP isn‚Äôt useful when you need highly dynamic functionality, such as Push Notifications or Web Payments, or really anything requiring additional JavaScript. In addition, since AMP pages are usually served from an AMP Cache, you won‚Äôt get the biggest Progressive Web App benefits on that first click, since your own Service Worker can‚Äôt run. On the other hand, a Progressive Web App can never be as fast as AMP on that first click, as platforms can safely and cheaply prerender AMP pages ‚Äì a feature that also makes embedding simpler (e.g. into an inline viewer).

Interesting that the AMP dev advocate is the creator of jQuery UI: Paul Bakaus. Wonder if he was frustrated with trying to make web more app-like and just settled on how I am currently thinking the web should act.
