First of all, css is not just css. It is complicated, just check out [Methods to Organize CSS | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/methods-organize-css/).

"It's funny how most css in js authors (including myself) don't feel static extraction  is that great. Wonder why peeps still want it. ðŸ¤”" - [@tkh44](https://twitter.com/tkh44/status/885925961346297857) "It can be really nice if you have a static site or page, but when dynamic values are involved extract vs inline use the same api. no real" "I would add in you can get some incredible code splits with inline mode and react-loader. You get your styles with js on demand."

Consider putting in `css-vars`

# CSS-in-JS vs Style-Objects-in-JS
- [Guillermo Rauch on Twitter: "@threepointone @natebirdman @tkh44 @ken_wheeler Yeah and ultimately I agree with @tkh44 strongly. I tried CSS in objects extensively but there's great conveniences to the CSS DSL for web"](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/881591905481510912)
- more copy/pastable for chrome devtools and Stack Overflow
- not all css features can be represented as objects in js

[A Unified Styling Language â€“ SEEK blog â€“ Medium](https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660)

css-in-js represents a TOOLING problem. Our tools should let us show classes inline, but actually declare them outside of the file.

# Cons
- [Alex Russell on Twitter: "PSA: embedding/applying CSS in JS is the surefire way to be on every slow path. Bloats memory, slows parsing & use, hurts caching. Avoid."](https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/845435543647248384)

# Inline styles
- [inline styles are worse on updates](https://twitter.com/intelligibabble/status/850808821865889792)

# Atomic CSS
- comments of [Letâ€™s Define Exactly What Atomic CSS is | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/)
  - "Correct. Youâ€™ll find no semantic class names here (unless youâ€™ve setup some helper classes)." Helper classes would just be React components.
- [How is tachyons different from inline styles? Â· Issue #12 Â· tachyons-css/tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/issues/12#issuecomment-59828967)

# Static styles
- static vs. dynamic styles. How best to denote each?
- Love `gloss`'s idea thinking about `style` defined as a `static`. See [example](https://github.com/motion/gloss#examples):
```jsx
import gloss from 'gloss'

const style = gloss()

@style class extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1 $black $bg="#fff">Test</h1>
  }

  static style = {
    h1: {
      fontSize: 22,
      color: [255, 255, 255],
      '&:hover': { color: 'red', },
      borderBottom: [2, 'solid yellow']
    },
    black: {
      color: 'black',
    },
    bg: color => ({
      background: color,
      borderBottom: [2, 'solid', color]
    })
  }
}
```

# Babel transforms to help

# Proposed solution
- This is a tooling problem. Perf and UX must be the top priority. DX can be done with better tooling.

- inline css peek?
  - write component with `cssStyle=` prop, which auto-generates css className and the external stylesheet

"dynamic bits with css vars -> awesome"

[Guillermo Rauch on Twitter: "@threepointone yep but very very interesting approach. Makes for a small codebase and you solve the perf problem telling the browser about dynamic parts"](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/857135883346202625)

[Elliott Sprehn on Twitter: "@slightlylate @wardpeet @sebmarkbage @threepointone @addyosmani @kylemathews @kentcdodds @yeoman Inline style (.style.foo = ...) or setting .cssText is probably the slowest way to apply style. Classes and ids would be the fastest."](https://twitter.com/ElliottZ/status/859502609756962816)
