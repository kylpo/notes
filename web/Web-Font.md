"I'd suggest using `font-display: swap;`, which will show the fallback font until the web font has loadedâ€”at which point it'll be replaced."

lineheight

Always consider line-height for wrapping text. All other vertical spacing is just margin/padding.

Thomas's problematic example of having 0 lineheight on desktop, then when sizing it down to mobile, it wraps without and spacing.

Declaring the webfont as first in family will cause a FOIT (Flash of invisible text) while the client downloads your font. How to fix this? Lazy load your font, then apply a css class to your html to use the newly downloaded font-family.

The invisible content flash is fixed, but now there is a flash of unstyled text (FOUT). How to fix this? Well, you can't really fix it, since you want your readers to view content asap. You can however lessen the effect of text shifting when your primary font has loaded by setting the secondary font to one that matches the character height and width. The font will change, but the content won't shift much, and should appear as an enhancement.

You can go further though. FOFT (Flash of faux text) will load ONLY the roman/normal font first, apply it, then download the bold, italic, and bold italic and apply them - reducing the time of FOUT.

Resiliency: if your font downloads timeout for whatever reason, no worries - your content still loads.
