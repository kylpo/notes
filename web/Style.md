# The "Style" Problem
What we refer to as "style" actually includes quite a few concepts:


Layout — how an element/component looks in relationship to others
Appearance — the characteristics of an element/component
Behavior and state — how an element/component looks in a given state

don't add layout styles directly to your component.
