Things to consider before writing any code

Fork this doc into Web Considerations and Web Suggestions. Suggestion style is like `DO: ___`, `WHY: ___`, like a style guide

# Feature Flags
- Build in a feature flag capability from the start. You'll eventually want it for A/B testing, staged releases, and potentially even a beta program.
- [Feature flags in React](http://blog.rstankov.com/feature-flags-in-react/)
- [react-bits/29.feature-flags-using-redux.md](https://github.com/vasanthk/react-bits/blob/master/patterns/29.feature-flags-using-redux.md)
- [ember-cli/babel-plugin-feature-flags: A babel transform for managing feature flags](https://github.com/ember-cli/babel-plugin-feature-flags) seems like a great approach. Features flags statically, and dynamically.

```js
import isEnabled from 'my-features';

if (isEnabled('new-feature')) {
  // code
}
```
becomes
```js
import isEnabled from 'my-features';

if (false) {
  // code
}
```

# Internationalization
- Important for reach, and difficult to bolt on after the fact. Build in Internationalization from the start.
- [Internationalizing React Apps â€“ Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/01/internationalizing-react-apps/)
- [globalizejs/globalize: A JavaScript library for internationalization and localization that leverages the official Unicode CLDR JSON data](https://github.com/globalizejs/globalize)
  - used by twitter lite
- `Strings` files so that they can all be translated. No inline text, not even the text of an "OK" button.
- [Jason Miller ðŸ¦Šâš› on Twitter: "@threepointone @nekrtemplar we use it a lot for internationalization: <Text id="HELLO">hello world</Text>"](https://twitter.com/_developit/status/856196870179258368)

# Use an 8-point grid system
- (spacial) Consistency is important to the overall feel of a product

# Typography

# Target browsers
- polyfill.io
  - [Andrew Betts on Twitter: "The marvellous people at the Guardian just went live with @polyfillio - now used by multiple major news sites! https://t.co/sFWGd9pJ1T"](https://twitter.com/triblondon/status/846707701220622336)

## Polyfills
If itâ€™s new syntax, you can probably transpile it
If itâ€™s a new object or method, you can probably polyfill it
If itâ€™s something clever that the browser does outside of your code, youâ€™re probably SOL

https://hackernoon.com/polyfills-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-or-maybe-a-bit-less-7c8de164e423#.jfpsi4auo

Polyfill fewer things by targeting only newer browsers
Only send polyfills to browsers that need them
Only polyfill things used in your code

http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-env/ will reduce the amount of features that are polyfilled based on the browsers you are targeting.
- doesn't actually shave off much: 6kb
- polyfill.io instead to load polyfills iff the browser needs it


# Theming
- use css variables. They're now supported in all major browsers (Edge just landed support).
  - [Serg Hospodarets on Twitter: "Huge news! After Microsoft EDGE 15 release today, CSS Custom Properties (aka CSS Variables) work cross-browser!!! ðŸ”¥ https://t.co/UzL2IsxdEV https://t.co/Aku2rFlgxY"](https://twitter.com/malyw/status/851913674021371904)

# SEO
- [SEO best practices and requirements for modern sites | John Mueller - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlP5rBynK3E)
  - URL most important
  - 1 URL per content
    - languages have disctinct urls, too
  - make links w/ `<a>`, not onclick
    - so googlebot can navigate your site
  - hidden content is devalued, as it isn't primary content
    - does this mean page transitions that fade in are missing out on SEO?
      - I asked John, and it seems like it should be OK. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TsGXF4wNqM&feature=youtu.be&t=43m9s.
      - It did make me think that it should be done with css-animation (not js triggering a transition) for non-google SEO though
    - what about lazy loaded images
      - Iâ€™m thinking lazy loaded/revealed content is bad for SEO, as it isn't rendered until scroll, which I don't think googlebot does
  - page transition delays might snapshot old page
    - if route changes, and there is a transition out that takes a certain amount of time
  - Google Search Console to check your sites
- Fetch As Google tool to see how googlebot indexes your site
- Is above the fold content ranked higher?
  - no, googlebot sees all of the content. What matters is semantic markup to link related content. Otherwise, googlebot wouldn't know that a div on some part of the page is related to another div further down.
- [Hidden text and links - Search Console Help](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66353?hl=en)
- SEO boosted by accessibility?

SEO is related to "location, location, location".

# App Components
- Stage Left, Stage Right, Modal, etc

# Layers system
- Interesting idea to formalize z-index and layers: https://github.com/fckt/react-layer-stack#rationale. This is the Layers tab of your WYSIWYG.

# Events

# Content
https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/writing-for-the-web.html

people don't read web pages, they scan. On average, people only read 20â€“28% of web page content. Reading from screens is much slower than reading from paper. People will give up and leave your site unless information is easy to access and understand.

Web users are often action oriented, "leaning forward" in the hunt for answers to their current question, rather than leaning back to absorb a good book.
