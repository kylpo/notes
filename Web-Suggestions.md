_WIP_

# Feature Flags
- Build in a feature flag capability from the start. You'll eventually want it for A/B testing, staged releases, and potentially even a beta program.
- [Feature flags in React](http://blog.rstankov.com/feature-flags-in-react/)
- [react-bits/29.feature-flags-using-redux.md](https://github.com/vasanthk/react-bits/blob/master/patterns/29.feature-flags-using-redux.md)
- [ember-cli/babel-plugin-feature-flags: A babel transform for managing feature flags](https://github.com/ember-cli/babel-plugin-feature-flags) seems like a great approach. Features flags statically, and dynamically.

```js
import isEnabled from 'my-features';

if (isEnabled('new-feature')) {
  // code
}
```
becomes
```js
import isEnabled from 'my-features';

if (false) {
  // code
}
```

# Internationalization
- Important for reach, and difficult to bolt on after the fact. Build in Internationalization from the start.

- [globalizejs/globalize: A JavaScript library for internationalization and localization that leverages the official Unicode CLDR JSON data](https://github.com/globalizejs/globalize)
  - used by twitter lite
- `Strings` files so that they can all be translated. No inline text, not even the text of an "OK" button.
