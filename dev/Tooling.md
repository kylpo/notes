_WIP_

Design and Dev are converging on building `components`.

I think now, more than ever, we are set up for a wysiwyg builder to become hugely powerful for design AND dev. First round is used to structure your app, then drop to code for tweaks, gestures, refinining animations, etc. A tool that gives me sane primitives, elements, and widgets, with a viewport showing off responsive points, a timeline, style editing pane, event editing pane, layers, etc will be amazing.
