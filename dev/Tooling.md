_WIP_

Design and Dev are converging on building `components`.
- [A Component-based Workflow for Sketch ‚Äì Abstract ‚Äì Medium](https://medium.com/goabstract/a-component-based-workflow-for-sketch-6d3556b18d4c)

I think now, more than ever, we are set up for a wysiwyg builder to become hugely powerful for design AND dev. First round is used to structure your app, then drop to code for tweaks, gestures, refinining animations, etc. A tool that gives me sane primitives, elements, and widgets, with a viewport showing off responsive points, a timeline, style editing pane, event editing pane, layers, etc will be amazing.

Also might align on scope of components, like Atomic Design.

It is about speaking the same language
