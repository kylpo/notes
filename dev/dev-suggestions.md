"ProTip: Keep your console free of warnings and errors\. Even if they are false alarms \(mute/fix them\)\. Getting used to errors will cost you\." - [Merrick Christensen](https://twitter.com/iammerrick/status/902295190748119040)

"Think like a fundamentalist, code like a hacker" - Erik Meijer

# Staying current
Just as an author needs to READ a lot to become/maintain good writing, so too do coders, designers, app developers. Spend time researching others work. Learn/steal/adapt/innovate with it.

# Testing
- "Learnt a useful tip: Add a 'data-test' attribute to dom elements so they can be easily found in tests." - [tweet](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/886939162070335489)

# Accessibility
- "Accessibility in UI tends to enforce that important information is somehow introspectable/testable. Good forcing function for engineering." - [jordanIsNotAFunction](https://twitter.com/jordwalke/status/881404629140905984)
- "accessibility has been a major driver of technological progress all across the board" - [Guillermo Rauch](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/881412412083027971)

# Functional Coding
building with functional programming is easier because of composition. You focus on one concern at a time, building more and more.

maintaining and reading is potentially harder because there are more places you need to jump around to to get the full picture.
