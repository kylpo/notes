Web is good for __infrequent__ things. E-commerce, directories, info, etc. Google, gmail, and even Facebook/Twitter make sense as native.

The web, to me, is all about content and information.

Thought about Google search being critical. I wouldn't really use google to find an app. I do use it to search web for image and such though.

First of all, I LOVE the web.

I love stumbling on the random forum where total strangers are helping each other. Such an amazing thing.

I really enjoy going down the rabbit hole. I love starting with a question, and taking the journey of cmd-clicking links, and seeing where it goes.

Do you ever play a video game long enough to feel like you've completely it without actually getting to the ending? I never finished Final Fantasy 8 or 10. For whatever reason, I just got the point where I was happy with my journey, and emotionally done.

This is how I feel about my journey on the web (for apps).

Chrome really is its own OS. Shoved into other OSes. Almost like Flash. Ominously like Flash... *feels hot computer and looks at Activity Monitor*...

App ---------------------------------- Site
 |                                       |
Full window                           tab/page

Web advantage: links
- `ctrl click` allows not context switching
- able to queue and batch up work

---

Things I know I prefer as native:
- music player

Things I know I prefer as web:
- feed reader (something that produces more tabs/links (`cmd + click`))

Is it OK to live in a sandbox (*app*, whether web or native)? Or does it need hook into the platform it lives on (native *extensions*)?

begs the question: *app* vs *extension*

[Chrome won | Andreas Gal](https://andreasgal.com/2017/05/25/chrome-won/?utm_source=frontendfocus&utm_medium=email)
- basically just Chrome and Safari

Start with story of always playing the hybrid class: druid. Burned by not ever being the best dmg dealer, tank, healer, etc.

Desktop web and Mobile web should probably be in different categories. Salesforce, Google, etc embrace desktop web, but not mobile web.

The realization of web-lite kind of goes counter to Mobile First design. Almost feels like we were led to think that we should build mobile apps on the web because of this Mobile First mantra.

DOM has its issues, but it is an __extensible__ rendering platform. Extensions, user styling, etc.

# Web vs Native
- Web is for accessibility, especially PWA (offline)
web is good for _content_
- Maybe it is about leaf nodes? If you have many sub-sites (ecommerce, articles/news), then web is the best platform. You want the one-demand render with reach.
- If you only have a handful of routes, then maybe it is specific enough to warrant Native?
- Will you use this service daily? It should be native.
- Web is good for the "oh, I'm just browsing" user
- Mobile web is good for consumption. Not really good for interaction though.
function over form
- Native gives you immersion
- Think about games, Hangouts, etc. All would be better w/ native controls (like system-wide mic mute, full screen, etc)
- SSR (bummer, wish we could try Preact, but Bing doesn't crawl js)

Sites are so amazing for research. Links, headers, cmd-click tabs, etc. We should embrace this!

Web for reach/exposure - Breadth
- web for anything that should/could be viewed anonymously
- does this support the AMP idea?

Native for experience - Depth
- native for anything that would normally require a login

examples to compare with: google plus, inbox, google fonts, mac store

https://medium.com/javascript-scene/native-apps-are-doomed-ac397148a2c0#.pfvxyzxl5

How does this compare to personal blog sites vs using a service like Medium or Twitter? I like being able to like posts now, and dislike when it is a personal site. Universal login is what matters here, I suppose.

---

The web is really good for reading and consumption. The tabs act like physical pages that you can flip through and stack.

An app, on the other hand, is good for experiences. A gameboy, a board game, a set of tools used for a purpose like calculators, journals, timers, etc.

https://cloudfour.com/thinks/progressive-web-apps-simply-make-sense/

Progressive Enhancement to consider:
Kind of cool that the browser works as well as it does with progressive enhancement.  Start with the least common denominator of features, then add attributes to your html and js. Amazing that it doesn't break the older browsers - they just ignore what they can't support. Really good model for plugin systems.

Interesting idea to think of web and native apps on opposite spectrums. Web is lowest common denominator and least featured/polish. Native is all about integration and experience. Goal is to move the needle of web as close to your native WITHOUT compromising. This is why perf budgets etc are so important.

Thought about this while reading https://justmarkup.com/log/2016/10/enhancing-a-comment-form/

"Native apps like Twitter, Facebook, & Instagram are swell, but appreciate for a moment that the web gives your posts universal addresses."
-https://twitter.com/stshank/status/806981502881759232

Web linkability

I think just about everything should be linkable. For example, a specific comment to an article.

"Web users are often action oriented, "leaning forward" in the hunt for answers to their current question, rather than leaning back to absorb a good book."
- https://www.nngroup.com/articles/concise-scannable-and-objective-how-to-write-for-the-web/
-- I wonder if users are more willing to "absorb a good book" when it is a native app?

AMP roadmap update: ‚ÄúYou can now also use <amp-app-banner> to drive installs of native apps from AMPs, as well as deep-link directly to native app content for users who have already installed your app‚Äù

Primarily notes to myself:

https://daverupert.com/2016/10/desktop-is-lava/ had some good points:
üîë Social networks, search engines, publications, and retailers have already hit the tipping point and are seeing majority mobile traffic. This is probably where your traffic comes from.
üîë Native App market is tightening. Most people don‚Äôt download apps.
üëç Mobile Web traffic is 3x native app traffic.
üëç Mobile Web audiences are growing 2x as fast as app audiences.
üëé Mobile Web engagement (time on site) is 20x less than apps.
üëé Mobile Web engagement is steadily decreasing.
üîë The Chrome Developers team has been single-mindedly focused on mobile performance lately. This is a huge foreshadowing signal.
üëç Desktop web browsing hasn‚Äôt been cannibalized by mobile‚Ä¶
üëé But it has stagnated. comScore reports a 16pt drop in Desktop usage over the last 3 years.

# Web
- all about scrolling
  - "scrolling has a special place on the web, and browsers have worked very hard to make sure that scrolling is snappy and responsive" (off-thread scrolling)
  - "The ‚Äúscroll‚Äù event, somewhat counterintuitively, can‚Äôt block scrolling because it fires after the scroll event, and thus it isn‚Äôt cancelable."
  - [Scrolling on the web: A primer - Microsoft Edge Dev BlogMicrosoft Edge Dev Blog](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/03/08/scrolling-on-the-web/#LG0e2AFJ6auj2GLH.97)

> The Web is simultaneously an application platform that blows all other platforms out of the water for delivering content. First, there's a reason why so many native apps embed WebViews -- despite its warts, CSS is the result of hundreds of person-years of tuning for deploying portable textual content.
> But more importantly, you just can't beat the URL. How many more times will we convince the entirety of humanity to know how to visually parse "www.zombo.com" on a billboard or in a text message? It's easy to take the Web for granted, it's fun to snark about its warts, and there's a cottage industry of premature declarations of its death. But I personally believe that the humble little hyperlink is at the heart of the Web's power, competitive strength, and longevity. It was a century-old dream passed on from Vannevar Bush to Doug Englebart to Xerox PARC and ultimately to TBL who made it real.

## Good Hybrid examples
- Todoist for MacOS
  - Seems to be a native appwith just a webview and a few custom, native pieces for things like menubar, global hotkeys, quick-add UI.
- Apple's App Store is an interesting example of a hybrid app using webviews.
  - It gives native controls and windowing, but also offers sharing links to content via urls to the site. Without the web portion of this, it'd be way harder to share content and bookmark it for later.

# Current Conclusions
- When to use Web
  - sites (documents, ecommerce)
    - likely came from a google search
  - desktop apps that do not need platform hooks
    - I can't really think of any that fall into this category. Hangouts, for example, will always be inferior to Skype's native app for me because Skype has the picture-in-picture floating window. A tab in a web browser is not likely to get this functionality soon.
  - apps (desktop and web) that are temporal. A user will only occasionally use this service. Example: banking sites.
  - power tabs

- When to use Native
  - Any "daily-driver" service
  - A service that may not be a daily-driver, but is not compelling without the rich gestures and/or platform hooks
  - logged in
- With mobile Safari bringing down the web as a whole, see __this__ link, I currently advize going native on mobile.

Web for your "base". Native to enhance.
- [Nicolas on Twitter: "Ultimately I think PWAs will make native Android apps and desktop wrappers unnecessary for most. Mobile-first PWA as the universal base app"](https://twitter.com/necolas/status/862923667067604992)

Web
- Accessible w/o install -> open, no store
- No storage constraints
- Always up to date
- Already won on desktop
- url/linkable

PWA
- Discoverable by all
- Fast/smooth
- loads quickly
- works offline
- progressively installed

Problems
- integrations (android wear, macOS menu bar)

[Progressive Web Apps ‚Äî Yeh or Meh?](http://developer.telerik.com/topics/web-development/progressive-web-apps-yeh-meh/?utm_source=mobilewebweekly&utm_medium=email)

PWA is probably really great for **sites** that would have low app engagement and installs, like Forbes: [Forbes - Redefining Modern Web Development - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=TLGGykzdoCyEWUAxNzA1MjAxNw&v=JmC0xkCMFCE). Should be called a Progressive Web Site, not App.

[Mike Grabowski on Twitter: "Interesting experience, just switched back to Twitter Native from PWA and fonts are much smaller!"](https://twitter.com/grabbou/status/867636983123902467)

PWA with Android Intents: What if you click link twice? Will it open two "apps"?

# STOP
- Stop using titles like [Progressive Web Apps: Great Experiences Everywhere (Google I/O '17) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-sCdS0sQO8)
- [Twitter Lite is a PWA Win - Thurrott.com](https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/116841/twitter-lite-pwa-win)

[(3) Steve Jobs Insult Response - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-tKLISfPE) seems to apply. "You've gotta focus on the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You can't start with the technology, and figure out where you're going to sell it." Focus on the user's experience. Not the tech, not the engineers. Focus on the cohesive experience as a whole.

[Kent C. Dodds on Twitter: "@satya164 The big question everyone has about not using the DOM for web apps is: Accessibility."](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/865278394354814976)
