# Services that make money
- Entertainment
- Fitting in
- Self Improvment (making the difficult more attainable)
- Safety (antivirus, security cameras)
- "Basic" life necessities (internet, phone bill)

# Simple
Always need to remind myself that focussing on SIMPLE is the most important thing. I want these amazingly powerful tools, but single-focussed, simple products are the ones that become popular.

# Publicize, promote, use every voice you can
One thing I noticed while walking through Microsoft's To-Do app: I'm super skeptical, and don't want to learn their system.

If I had heard good things about it, however, I'd be more likely to care about learning it.

# Standing out
Products need to stand out. Maybe the easiest way is through good, immersive design.

http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/07/health/parallels/sleep/ is a good example

# API first
The ATM is a really interesting example of building API-first. In its early incarnations, people would write down how much money they want, insert the slip, then people behind the machine would take it and figure out how much money to give back.

The technology wasn't there to automate things the way they are today, but the interface and idea was.

# Start with Good Enough
Build a good enough product, then iterate and improve. Like mongoDB vs rethinkDB. Also, like Google does.

# Themeing
I have to have theming in my apps

http://sciencefictioninterfaces.tumblr.com/ is just really inspiring to me, for whatever reason. If all of my morning apps were themed this way, I'd be very happy.

Wouldn't work as well when needing to be productive though.

# Document, or Database?
Are you saving content to a document (local or remote), or is it saved in a database (local sqlite or remote)?

If it is a document, you might want to register your app for the document's format.

If you're persisting only to a database, your users may appreciate an `Export` option to a document, even if it is just a `json`, `csv`, or `xml`.
