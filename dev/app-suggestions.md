# Services that make money
- Entertainment
- Fitting in
- Self Improvment (making the difficult more attainable)
- Safety (antivirus, security cameras)
- "Basic" life necessities (internet, phone bill)

# Simple
Always need to remind myself that focussing on SIMPLE is the most important thing. I want these amazingly powerful tools, but single-focussed, simple products are the ones that become popular.
