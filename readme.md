# [kylpo](https://twitter.com/kylpo)'s Public Notes
Likely unfinished thoughts/research

## Note
A goal of this repo is to get better about writing notes down as I learn. I plan to build these notes with stating questions, then answering them. Once I'm done researching, I hope to update them to something blogpost-worthy.

Also just nice to have a URL for recurring thoughts/conversations.

## Many notes will end up in a playbook
- [React Playbook](https://github.com/kylpo/react-playbook)
- [Web Playbook](https://github.com/kylpo/web-playbook)
- [Dev Playbook](https://github.com/kylpo/dev-playbook)
