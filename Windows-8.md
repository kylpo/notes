For years I've been saying Windows 8 would've been a success, and Microsoft would've remained dominant in the desktop/laptop space, if it had just slapped an App Store onto Windows 7. All it needed was a place to easily advertise and promote the legacy/desktop applications that had already existed on the platform. That's it.

How do I know I'm right? Look at MacOS. This is exactly what they've done. They have a successful app store with rich, productive, powerful apps that are able to hook in as Extension Points to the OS, enhancing the environment, not just an isolated app experience, and be wonderful tools to those with keyboards and mice/trackpads. Very similar apps to what you find in the legacy/desktop applications on windows 10 today. You know, the ones you download from the web (like Microsoft Office, Outlook, and OneNote), not the one from the Windows Store. You can even find the desktop-quality [OneNote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-onenote/id784801555?mt=12) in Mac's App Store!

You see, the Windows Store is a desolate place today because it only promotoes Universal Windows Platform apps (touch-first, "dumbed down" (for lack of a better term) apps).


Microsoft was a king in the desktop space. It built amazing apps, and Windows 7 had plenty of capabilities and hooks to enable them to do it. Amazing applications that just CAN'T be translated to UWP apps. So when the store was released, instead of showcasing the power by promoting its own products like Apple (install Keynote, Pages, iMove, Xcode, even OS upgrades in their app store), it showcased a wasteland of completely underpowered apps. The Mail client, for example, had to be embarassing.

Fast-forward to today, I see Microsoft doubling down on their mistake with Windows 10 S. They are promoting a new OS that can ONLY use apps from their App Store. Students will surely be productive with these UWP apps, right? No, which is why they've enabled Windows 10 S (only!) users to install the legacy/desktop version of Office from the app store.

My recommendation is to open up the app store completely. Let me as a power user have a reason to open the store. Let me as a developer have a reason to develop for Windows (over MacOS). OR go the way of Apple and have separate app stores for laptop/desktop devices and touch-first devices (iOS). I have no problems with Windows 10 S on a tablet or phone, just don't push it on me as a laptop/desktop user.
