## Reasons to hate Apple
> It's so ridiculous that on iOS Safari has ServiceWorker but Chrome for iOS does not.
> This is because Apple has banned all web rendering engines except for WebKit. So, Chrome for iOS is just a wrapper around a WebKit web-view which... don't support ServiceWorker. ðŸ˜

> Chromium's Blink is the de facto web rendering engine, but Apple's draconian App Store rules still mandate apps (even Chrome iOS) use Safari for web rendering. If such rules were in place on Desktop back in the day Chrome wouldn't existâ€¦ Competition is good y'all.
