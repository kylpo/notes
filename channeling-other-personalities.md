Channel certain personalities/people when I need them, in the moment. E.g. Andrew dealing with contractors.

---

What if there is no room for being "well rounded" and "good at everything" in this world. Instead, you need to channel different `you`s. While playing Dixit, for example, I can not be the logical, mechanical person that I am while coding. While thinking about big ideas (like my current state of mind), I can not be a productive machine, etc.

If that is true, then how can I trigger certain personalities when I want them, and quiet the others?
