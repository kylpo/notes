What is the "app formula"?

Make failure cost less by building the simplest __useful__ thing, plus:

- Fun is a feature
  - Helps make an app "sticky" - a user will be more likely to come back to it
- Ask for reviews. They won't come on their own.
  - Ask after many uses of app. Do it in a casual, non-modal way.

## Types of users
Friendly for first-timers.
Configurable for power-users.

was actually thinking about this in regards to games like wow that have a pretty mediocre gui. But I remember addons were to tweak and add/subtract for the default gui.

## Tips
Don't overthink it. Pick direction, then learn and reflect. don't spend time agonizing in the moment.

You want users not frustrated with an experience and demanding more (the Apple way).

You are what you measure, so choose carefully
