I find it interesting that Xbox was bold enough to create this premium product. Replaceable rear paddles with a great grip feel, adjustable paddle travel, and a profile switcher!? So cool!

BUT, it irks me that they weren't going for it, 100%. They have a fallback of not requiring the rear paddles to be used: the front buttons are still available. The way I see it, either you like the rear paddles and you buy the elite, or you don't, and you can't justify the price of the Elite... I've seen plenty of Elites for sale where the seller just didn't like the paddles.

With this in mind, why have the backup plan? Why cripple this wonderful idea with a partial build. I want a 100% Elite controller. One with paddles, great grip feel, and flawless ergonomics with the joysticks mirrored towards the top of the controller. Not a right thumb shoved down below where it should be positioned to make room for the originial controller's primary buttons.

Worried about newer users that won't know what to do when the A, B, etc show up on screen? Just label them on the controller. Would be easy enough to mark which paddle is which from the front of the controller.

I want a 100% Elite controller.
