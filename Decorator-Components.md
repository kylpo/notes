_WIP_

Whether components that don't actually add anything to the dom is a good practice or not, I'd like to propose a naming convention to clearly identify them for skimmers and tools.

Community naming conventions are great. `_private`, `$jQuerySelector`, `js-className`, etc

`<Style_ />` simply decorates a child. `Name_` syntax implies that a single child is required.

Extra credit: React Router v4 to use `<_Redirect_ />`

## Libs that would benefit from the syntax:
