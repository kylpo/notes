Frustrated with the weak options of the Mac Mini and high price tag of the MacBook Pro (and touchbar, low battery life, etc), I resigned myself to trying Windows and a workstation. This is no ordinary workstation tower though, instead, it is a small, powerful unit that hides on the back of my monitor and only cost me $750 for a core i7, 16gb ram, 256gb SSD setup. I'm really impressed with the NUC!

# The Hardware
[Amazon\.com: Intel BOXNUC7I7BNH NUC Kit Components: Computers & Accessories](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N0RL8Q4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) comes with everything needed (even a microphone in) but your ram and hard drive. This includes your cpu, wifi, multiple ports, etc.

For my ram, I chose a [single Crucial 16gb](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015YPB6HQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (not a double of 8gb) so I can easily upgrade it to 32gb in the future if I'd like.

For my SSD, I agonized a bit about whether to go with this [960 EVO](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYFKX41/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) or its more performant brother, [960 PRO](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXS4TYB?ref=emc_b_5_t), but ultimately went with the EVO because it still has really impressive performance, and allowed me to get a final price tag under $750.

I mentioned that the NUC hides behind my monitor. This was made easy because it comes with a VESA mount, and [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WJOYG6Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) extension bracket provided the additional slot to fit on to.

# The Software
OK, we now have a powerful system, but the only thing it can do is boot into BIOS. It does not come with an operating system installed, so we've gotta do it. As I didn't want to pay >$100 for Windows 10, I decided to go with the free build of [Windows 10 Insider](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced). And thank goodness I chose the free option, because after a few days, I found a deal breaker (TODO: link) with Windows, that sent me down the path of Linux.

Not wanting to completely erase all of my work in setting up Windows, I decided to set up my system as a dual boot. I used Windows 10 Partition Manager to make room for a linux install, then followed [these](http://wegotserved.com/2017/02/02/dual-boot-ububntu-windows-10-intel-nuc/3/) directions to install Ubuntu.

> Note to the skimmers: If you plan to dual boot Windows/Linux, I do recommend you install Windows first, then Linux. Seems like the other way around is more tricky.
