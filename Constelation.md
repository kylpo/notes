_WIP_

Think of components in a GUI tool
- Elements/Primitives on left to grab are View, Text, Image, ...
- Property editing on right:
  - Style_, Animate_, Event_ would be tabs
  - props would be editable fields in tabs

Would love for this to one day fold in to a WYSIWYG editor. It'd use all of constelation-primitive, so it is really easy for devs to drop down into code. Use the prototype tool for quick layouts and explorations, then code for the polish.
