Do read through [CSS in JS: The Argument Refined – Medium](https://medium.com/@steida/css-in-js-the-argument-refined-471c7eb83955#.dwrvgfn6d), as he has gone down a similar journey.

Writing style
- Structure similar to [junctions.js](https://junctions.js.org/?utm_campaign=Fullstack%2BReact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Fullstack_React_49) with starting "Why use Constelation?"
  - Extreme separation of concerns
  - Powerful base primitives
  - Copy-pastability
  - Skimability
- Motivations similar to [Motivation - junctions.js](https://junctions.js.org/guide/introduction/motivation)
- [How do you write such amazing documentations? · Issue #21 · staltz/ama](https://github.com/staltz/ama/issues/21)

Mindset of cranking widgets enables creativity. Don't need to "solve" trivial problems over and over.
- Inspired by [GTD Newsletter: How to make your job easier](http://us8.campaign-archive2.com/?u=4fdf2cadb358acc7c1c1ca8bd&id=a0680a8e72&e=3d3d97c32e)

Think of components in a GUI tool
- Elements/Primitives on left to grab are View, Text, Image, ...
- Property editing on right:
  - Style_, Animate_, Event_ would be tabs
  - props would be editable fields in tabs

Would love for this to one day fold in to a WYSIWYG editor. It'd use all of constelation-primitive, so it is really easy for devs to drop down into code. Use the prototype tool for quick layouts and explorations, then code for the polish.
