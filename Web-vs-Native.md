# Web
- all about scrolling
  - "scrolling has a special place on the web, and browsers have worked very hard to make sure that scrolling is snappy and responsive" (off-thread scrolling)
  - "The “scroll” event, somewhat counterintuitively, can’t block scrolling because it fires after the scroll event, and thus it isn’t cancelable."

## Pros
- ["Available anywhere, on-demand, low storage, low power use, etc. These are things both users and companies want from apps. Web nearly there"](https://twitter.com/necolas/status/850437592285708288)
- ["And once the web supports first-class apps, other wins emerge: low running costs (cheaper services, smaller teams) and fast iteration"](https://twitter.com/necolas/status/850439907726114816)
- ["The web seems to be the only app platform that is hyper-focused on making apps smaller and more performant. It's inherent to the platform."](https://twitter.com/polotek/status/850395053935570944)
  - "For any product that is growing and innovating, the apps tend to get more complicated, slower and buggier over time."
  - "That includes web apps. But the web is the only platform that also has counter-pressure, forcing apps to consider bloat a top level issue."
  - "That's a strategic advantage for the web. Twitter was actually incentivized to bring us a better mobile web experience."
