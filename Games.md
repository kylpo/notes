I am convinced I could start a successful gaming company that just rips off and re-brands custom maps from WC3 and Starcraft.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.crtd looks a bit like one of them.

Good Guy Games

In a comment: "Really the best thing we can learn from videogames is that even if its hard, keep trying and find another strategy that works better. Change your approach and try again. Don’t be disheartened when you lose, because you just learned another strategy that doesn’t work, so you can hone in on one that does. As an entrepreneur now, my lifetime of playing videogames has helped me figure out problems in my business."

Educational games like:
- [Orbit \- Playing with Gravity](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ChetanSurpur.Orbit)
  - ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uer_X6AtHnWvCq28wYYGTVrlEmD135FMyDmaTVQ3xNuyayixsmil7JAv2kHJ1Vs1Dn4=h900-rw)
- [Rube's Lab \- Physics Puzzle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onlinico.rubeslab)
  - ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/50BHYdi2TBDUO488okKRFnPAmDeWZr8uVTsSA6Q67waI2peUJYzhv7hIxtRjg3UJAFu4=h900-rw)
- [SPACEPLAN](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devolver.spaceplan)

- [Euclidea](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hil_hk.euclidea)
  - Seems like this one might even help artists learn ways of creating shapes in other editors like Photoshop

One thing I learned about playing on my phone: I like not having to rotate the phone. Portrait games have less activation energy (Clash Royale, Hades' Star, Card Monsters). Any new game I opened that went to landscape felt like a negative.

Some can last forever, others will eventually end, and your goal is to last as long as possible.

---

Some games are just about twitch and muscle memory, really. Hellrider2, Guitar Hero, Flappy Bird. You'll end up playing levels a LOT before advancing.

----

Hybrids are interesting, like the combo TD/shooter called War Boxes Defend. You construct turrets to defend the objective, but also have controls to move around a tank and shoot.

Stampede seems to combine Runner (main game) with Grinds (collect animals to improve zoo)

----

I actually think HeavenStrike Rivals has the exact gameplay experience I'm looking for in a mobile game. Grid based, summoner (that has abilities), individual units that must move foward, and can jump around to other rows, with interesting powerup combos.

The game is plague with loading screens though. This alone kills it for me. I wonder if this wouldn't be a problem if I was in a different context like playing from desktop?

---

Rocket League seems like a perfect fit for Nintendo Switch

Godus and Polytopia have shown me that I *REALLY* like polygon art in mobile games

Things to consider:
- Play perspective: 1st, 3rd (top-down? from side?)
- vs computer or others (or both)
- levels the same? Or random?
- game grid: 1d, 2d, 3d?

Grinds
- All about improving gear, level, buildings, stats, etc
- Tap Titans
- Diablo 3
- Idle Heroes - even auto attacks. pvp is just setting your team vs others team, where auto-attacks happen. AKA, person with best equipment will always win.
- Lords Mobile looks like you command these troops in wars, but really, you focus on your city, upgrades, etc and just tell you troops to attack. They auto-attack.
- Boom Beach at least lets you control a couple things when you attack. I assume this is also what Clash of Clans is like.
- The Sims

Puzzle
- Hitman Go
- 

+Strategy
- Builder/positional planner
  - Polytopia
  - Cities: Skyline
  - Concrete Jungle
  - Mini Metro
- Survival
- Tower Defense (Are these actually more like puzzle solvers? The levels don't change, you just fail enough to figure out what combination beats things. Unless, of course you're playing a TD against other players, where you send troops and defend)
  - Realm Defense
- Reverse Tower Defense (Royal Revolt 2)

Survival
- vs computer:
  - Hades' Star felt a bit like Eve, but without the pvp, also control more than one unit. Still the pay-to-not-wait model for sending ships faster, speeding up mining, etc.

CCG
- type of arena (1 lane, like in Magic and Hearthstone, 2 like Titan Brawl, grid like Duelyst and Summoner Wars, even hexagon (like Go) in Combat Monsters). Also ones where there are multiple lanes, but only one card can exist in it (like Order and Chaos Duels with its 5 columns)
- build your own? (most allow you to craft a deck, but Summoner Wars doesn't)
- Sometimes your units auto-move and auto-attack, like HeavenStrike Rivals. Sometimes you tell what units should do what, and when, like Heroes of Might and Magic, Final Fantasy.

Brawlers
- Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, mobile ones like Transformers
- Super Smash Brothers

Racing
- Mario Kart
- Gran Turismo

Runner
- You auto-move forward
- Third Person (no directional, just press buttons)
  - Press buttons to dodge, like Alto, 
- Third Person (one directional)
  - Space/plane shooters where you just move left-right
  - Sky Force Reloaded

Shooters/Runners
- First Person
  - Counter Strike
- Third Person (two directional)
  - Soul Knight
  - Bomberman qualifies here, I think?


Combo racer and Shooter: Battle Bay

Mobile games I have enjoyed:
- Sky Force Reloaded
- Titan Brawl
- Clash Royale
- Polytopia
- Mini Metro

**taken from my random thoughts doc**
When you feel like you have extra (or all of the) time in the world, my god does it feel good. An unexpected three day weekend, being caught up in a moment, not thinking about the stresses and pressures of what'll happen in a few days.

Also why games are so fun. You forget your time limitations while playing.

Good criticism of games like Ark of War:

"I dont like games like this , only upgrade upgrade upgrade , and the battle is just an "Attack" button and rewards after 3 seconds , what a waste of time﻿"

from a comment on [\(2\) ARK OF WAR : First Impressions? \- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juH3m_C9ji0)
