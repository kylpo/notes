# All About Refs
# Refs: Beyond the Basics
`ref` is one of React's magical props, in that it is used by React itself, not by the component that attach the `ref` to. If it is placed on a primitive like `<div ref={...} />`, it will give you the DOM node instance. If it is placed on a composite component like `<MyComponent ref={...} />`, it will give you the component instance.

Cool, you likely already knew that, but did you know:

If you haven't read the official docs or haven't read it in a year or so, I recommend you read it. It even covers functional components not being `ref`-able.

I do have a few things to add to the topic that justify this post though.

## When to use ref

## no ref for functional components
- You may not use the ref attribute on functional components because they don't have instances. https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#refs-and-functional-components

## ref callbacks
- callbacks, how to avoid boilerplate? called on when unmounted (passes null)?
- how to reduce boilerplate with something like https://github.com/fresk-nc/babel-plugin-transform-jsx-ref-to-function?
- wish I could have a `setRef` prop that just accepts a pointer to my instance field.
OK, fine, callback refs replaced string refs. This gives us more power! But, dang, this does add more boilerplate.

## when is it set?

## called with null
