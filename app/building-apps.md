TDD and analytics-backed from the start

## The way I want to build products
Design STRUCTURE first. Normally this would be gray-box mockups, but gray-box was just a low level primitive that required little config and thought. This primitive can be replaced now with Material Design primitives.

Visually build out that structure as developer in Navigation and Design modes.

TDD the wiring up of these static screens.

Tests can not, and should not cover your design, so test should 100% cover the FUNCTIONALITY of an app. This includes verifying the visibility of something after an animation has finished, but not that the buttons' corners are rounded, for instance.

## User Testing
Nevermind if you'd use it or buy it. What things do you expect to see or use that aren't here?

First, set them up with "You've just downloaded the app from the app store, which said something like "..."". Before opening the app, what do you expect to be able to do? (write down this list)

Nevermind if this appeals to you. If you were forced to use it, what do you think you'd use it for?

Now, open it.

Ask them what they want to do. Any surprises here? What do you think the touch targets are? How do you navigate? etc. What is missing? Is there a "Killer feature"? Would this solve an actual problem in your life?

Ask techie friends, designery friends, regular friends.
