Development is binary: it works, or it doesn't. Especially in the TDD flow.

Design, is not. It is a world of grays (pun intended).

I like being able to experience binary and grays throughout my day. The freedom of certainty and stability of development, and the freedom of creativity and exploration of design.

## Designing with consequences.
If I blow it, I'm gonna build it, then I have to build the better version.
