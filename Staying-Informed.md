# How I Stay Informed
With software development constantly in flux, it has taken quite an effort to dial in my system for staying informed. "The right tool for the right job" is the name of the game.

## Twitter
I use Twitter for one thing: following developers. I appreciate tuning in to their public discussions and seeing links/retweets of useful resources.

#### Using the timeline
Because I treat the timeline like more of a reading list, I use [Tweetmarker](http://tweetmarker.net/) to save the progress of where I am. Sure is nice to not feel FOMO while I'm working. Why doesn't Twitter just build this into their platform?! Tweetmarker also works with [Tweetbot for Mac](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/) and [Flamingo for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.twitter&hl=en), keeping my progress synced across devices.

When I have a few free minutes (waiting for a build, taking a break, etc), I'll skim through the timeline, favoriting (read "bookmarking") if it seems worth going back to. And at the end of the day, following the "Inbox Zero" approach, I try to read through all of these favorites, unchecking them as I go.

#### Focus
Developers are people, with non-developery things they'd like to talk about. I have nothing against them, but their non-developer thoughts do not fit in with my Twitter utility. This is why I use Tweetbot's `Mute Filters` feature to hide tweets about things like 'Trump', 'Hilary', 'Clinton', 'election', 'religion', etc.

Sometimes, despite a person having great thoughts and tweets, they're just too chatty for me to handle in my system. So, I just unsubscribe and rely on others to retweet the highlights.

## Github
I use the hell out of Github's `subscribe` feature for Issues and Pull Requests, which sends me an email when someone responds in a thread. It helps me get a gauge for when a feature will land, and how it is being considered.

When I have a pain point with a project, I'll search the repo for an active Issue/PR and `subscribe`. I'll also just periodically check repos of projects I rely on to see if there are new, good threads to subscribe to.

Sometimes, I'll temporarily `watch` repos, which auto-subscribes me to all Issues/PRs.

## Digests
There's just SO much information out there every week/day/hour. So, I lean on others to cull through it, and provide me digests of what they think is most interesting. Some digests are sent daily, but I prefer the weekly ones.

Also, I use [Inbox](https://inbox.google.com/)'s `Bundle` feature to collect all of these digests, and hide them until a designated time the next day. Sure wish the time of day was configurable, but 7am will do...

## Blogs
Back in the Google Reader days, I was an avid RSS user, slurping in 100+ posts/day. I treated it the way I treat Twitter today: as a reading list.

I suppose I still use [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) as a reading list, but I follow significantly fewer blogs. I'd love to just be able to reduce this service into a single, weekly digest.

## Podcasts
I use [Pocket Casts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts/) because it is cross platform (including browser), syncs progress, and has a speed-up option. For speakers without strong accents, I enjoy listening at 1.5x speed.

When I get in the car to drive to work, I turn on my [bluetooth receiver](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MJMV0GU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Turning it on auto-launches Android Auto on my phone, which has Pocket Casts positioned prominently at the top. Pocket Casts is configured to play through all downloaded podcasts, so I just press Play, and I'm on my way.

Despite preaching for "the right tool for the right job", I sure would love to have one reading list tool to combine all of these consumption resources. Maybe someday...
