_WIP_

# Twitter
- Stars act as bookmarks
  - Sticking with the "Inbox Zero" mantra, I try to go through all every night
- only follow developers (or whatever you most care about staying informed of)

# Github
- use the hell out of `subscribe`
  - dig through issues, PRs, etc and subscribe to the ones you want to know when they land
