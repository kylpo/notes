_WIP_

The right tool for the right job. I use apps and services with a specific purpose: Twitter and Github for following developers and their discussions, Newsletters, Blogs, and Podcasts.

# How I Stay Informed
## Twitter
I use Twitter for one thing: following developers. I appreciate tuning in to their public discussions and seeing links/retweets of useful resources.

- All of these social media platforms are just about simplifying communication. Simplify in sending, and sharing/spreading.

#### Using the timeline
So, I treat the timeline like more of a reading list. I use tools that save the progress of where I am on the timeline. When I have time to go through it, I usually skim, adding a Star if it seems worth going back to. At the end of the day, I go through

I use Tweetbot to keep track of the placement in my timeline. That way I can read through the list a couple times/day instead of continuously.

- Stars act as bookmarks
  - Sticking with the "Inbox Zero" mantra, I try to go through and unstar all every night

#### Focus
Only follow developers (or whatever you most care about staying informed of)
- Filter out tweets not related to your focus with Tweetbot's `Mute Filters`
- Some mutes I currently use: 'Trump', 'Hilary', 'Clinton', 'election', etc
- If some is too chatty or off-focus, I unsubscribe and rely on others to retweet the highlights

## Github
- Use the hell out of `subscribe`
  - Dig through issues, PRs, etc and subscribe to the ones you want to know when they land
  - Subscribe to github issues and PRs. Every week or so I'll browse some repos of what I use today for new exciting features.

## Digests
I lean on others to cull through the many resources in the world.

I completely rely on daily and weekly digests to keep me informed without being overwhelmed.

I use Inbox's Bundle feature to collect all of these and configure them to only be shown once a day. Sure wish the time of day was configurable, but 7am will do...

## Blogs
TODO

Feedly has been great

## Podcasts
I use [Pocket Casts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts/) because it is cross platform (including browser), syncs progress, and has a speed-up option. For speakers that do not have strong accents, I enjoy listening at 1.5x speed.
