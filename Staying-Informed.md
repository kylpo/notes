_WIP_

# Twitter
- Stars act as bookmarks
  - Sticking with the "Inbox Zero" mantra, I try to go through all every night
- only follow developers (or whatever you most care about staying informed of)
- All of these social media platforms are just about simplifying communication. Simplify in sending, and sharing/spreading.

# Github
- use the hell out of `subscribe`
  - dig through issues, PRs, etc and subscribe to the ones you want to know when they land
  - subscribe to github issues and PRs. Every week or so I'll browse some repos of what I use today for new exciting features.

# Newsletters
hacker news digest, react, js

also daily ones like the designs
