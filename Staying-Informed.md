# How I Stay Informed
## Twitter
I use Tweetbot to keep track of the placement in my timeline. That way I can read through the list a couple times/day instead of continuously.

- Stars act as bookmarks
  - Sticking with the "Inbox Zero" mantra, I try to go through and unstar all every night
- Only follow developers (or whatever you most care about staying informed of)
  - Filter out tweets not related to your focus with Tweetbot's `Mute Filters`
  - Some mutes I currently use: 'Trump', 'Hilary', 'Clinton', 'election', etc
- If some is too chatty or off-focus, I unsubscribe and rely on others to retweet the highlights
- All of these social media platforms are just about simplifying communication. Simplify in sending, and sharing/spreading.

## Github
- Use the hell out of `subscribe`
  - Dig through issues, PRs, etc and subscribe to the ones you want to know when they land
  - Subscribe to github issues and PRs. Every week or so I'll browse some repos of what I use today for new exciting features.

## Digests
I use Inbox's Bundle feature to collect all of these and configure them to only be shown once a day

- hacker news digest, react, js
- The Week for summaries of non-developer news

also daily ones like the designs

## Blogs
Feedly has been great

## Podcasts
I use Pocket Casts because it is cross platform (including browser), syncs progress, and has a speed-up option. For speakers that do not have strong accents, I enjoy listening at 1.5x speed.
