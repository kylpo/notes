# Why I like it
Steel is Democratic metal, just like android.

As a developer, I like android because it lets my imagination run wild! Lock screen apps, instant apps, widgets,
overlays, all the things!

# Why I'm falling in love with Android all over again
Recently, I've been researching OS platforms and their capabilites. Because I landed on MacOS as the best desktop and power user option, I thought I should give iOS another hard look. Also, not gonna lie, the ARKit is compelling. What I learned in my iOS vs Android is that Android is just so well positioned to continue dominance.

Floating windows, lapdock, etc. Termux, AIDE. mouse support.

I'd love to be able to go all-in on Android as an experiment. Just wish there were good android tablets. Also wish Google would make Android devleopment ON an Android device a first-class priority.

Give me an android "Surface"!!!!

## Best Practices and Conventions
- [android\-guidelines/project\_and\_code\_guidelines\.md at master ¬∑ ribot/android\-guidelines](https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines/blob/master/project_and_code_guidelines.md)
- [futurice/android\-best\-practices: Do's and Don'ts for Android development, by Futurice developers](https://github.com/futurice/android-best-practices)

## android.widget vs android.app
android.widget - mechanism
- shows state to the user
- reports user interaction events to higher level portions of app

## Android's own "VirtualDOM" (how widgets are drawn)
Android has its own form of Virtual DOM, called DisplayList. It is a representation of a tree of rendering commands for
a view that was invalidate()d, traversal()d. This optimization took over the old draw() imperative command.

Java side produces diff of changes, then render thread takes over to apply those changes with the gpu (to
canvas/opengl).

Render Thread: thread responsible for issuing display list operations to GPU. It only talks to GPU, nothing else.

android.app - policy (fragments, activities)
- defines WHAT state to bind to widgets
- HOW to respond to user interaction and HOW to issue changes to model

## Questions I had
#### Layouts in XML? Or programmatic?
- [Anko Layouts ¬∑ Kotlin/anko Wiki](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko/wiki/Anko-Layouts#why-a-dsl)
- Programmatic is a bit better for performance
- XML can use the visual layout builder. Programmatic does not.

#### Use Google Drive to sync apps across device?
Not really possible. Drive is used to backup and restore.

#### Clean Architecture?
All about making Tests fast, isolated, repeatable. Each layer only cares about one thing.

More notes:

Their prescribed architecture pattern is MVVM (Model-View-View Model) and it uses the ViewModel to source data from a repository, apply presentation logic and pass it to the view using LiveData.

could become bloated with the business logic required to map together these disparate data sources

Nice images here, too: https://medium.com/@thereallukesimpson/clean-architecture-with-mvvmi-architecture-components-rxjava-8c5093337b43


Data layer is represented by Repository interfaces. All data needed for the application comes from this layer. Each repository works with a single, well-defined aspect of application (users, messages, events inbox, etc)

Domain layer‚Äôs element is UseCase. UseCase‚Äôs role is to combine data layer elements to perform a combination of data operations.

- Business rules here: all the logic happens in this layer. Regarding the android project, you will see all the interactors (use cases) implementations here as well.
- This layer is a pure java module without any android dependencies. All the external components use interfaces when connecting to the business objects.

./gradlew runUnitTests - Execute domain and data layer tests (both unit and integration).

./gradlew runAcceptanceTests - Execute espresso and instrumentation acceptance tests.


A ViewState is just a data container, holding all the information the view needs to render himself.
-  the view is observing changes in a ViewState objects. These ViewStates are delivered by LiveData objects. The LiveData objects being updated, and are part of, a presenter.

ViewModel has the ViewState, and updates it for the View to observe. It is a data class within the ViewModel.
