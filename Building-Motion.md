_WIP_

Always visualize the layers in 3d moving. Then build out the layers.

- Nice videos showing this at https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/navigational-transitions.html

Think about things in layers. Shared Element Transition, for example just introduces a new layer with a clone of your image. It then expands that image in the new layer, optionally adding a white opacity effect to the content behind.

Transitions are a form of Animation. TransitionGroup is just a Navigator.
