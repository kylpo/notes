# Against Recommendations
I'd like services to stop implicitly recommending content to me. The Youtube recommendations, for example, are only distracting. Instead, I would prefer to go back to the way things were: show **related** material.

I don't want recommendations to go away, I just want to say "ok, I'm ready for your recommendations" explicitly, not allow them to derail what I'm try to learn about.
