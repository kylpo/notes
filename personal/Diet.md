We grow food to feed cows. Growing food takes space + energy, growing cows takes space + energy. Skip the cow and just go from food to humans to reduce the space and energy required to feed us.

# Seeds and fruit for breakfast
>Grains, beans, nuts and seeds are all in the same family as they are actually all seeds. Grains grow from the seeds of grasses, such as wheat, corn, oats or rice. Nuts, such as almonds, pecans, and walnuts, come from the seeds of a tree. And then there are the ones we refer to as seeds directly, such as sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds [that are found in fruits].
>
>All plants need assistance in dispersing their seeds as they are unable to move, so they need a way to create their own way of migrating, like growing delicious fruits around their seeds in order to entice animals, and humans, to eat them and carry them off to another location where the seeds are eventually spread.
>
>Grass seeds like wheat or corn do not have fruit. They rely mainly on the wind to disperse their seeds as they weren’t designed by nature to be eaten. Grains are actually toxic to humans in their raw state.
