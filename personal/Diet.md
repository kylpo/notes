# I eat like a bird for breakfast (seeds and berries)
blueberry, goji, raspberry, strawberry.

side: did you know that raspberry and strawberry are not technically berries, but banannas are?

# I eat like a horse for dinner (grains + veggies)
Grains like barley, bulgur, rice, quinoa. And beans like black, white, garbanzo, lentils. Also lots of veggies.

# What do I eat like for lunch?
Raw veggies and fruit. Sometimes fish.

Eat like a bunny for lunch (raw veggies)? What about my sardines then?

Turtles eat fish and raw veggies (esp. dark, leafy greens: 80%) and fruit (20%)!

I eat like a **turtle** for lunch.

# On the weekends, or when out with friends, I get to eat like Taz.

# Why Pescatarian
https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/if-everyone-ate-beans-instead-of-beef/535536/

We grow food to feed cows. Growing food takes space + energy, growing cows takes space + energy. Skip the cow and just go from food to humans to reduce the space and energy required to feed us.

why vegetarian? Just seems like we should be better than that. Meat should be special. As it was back in the days when people raised their livestock to sustain themselves.

## Thoughts on "Why distinguish between the flesh of sea and land animals?"
People claiming pescatarian doesn't make sense: "Why distinguish between the flesh of sea and land animals?"

That isn't really the divide for me. It is more about intelligence and empathy. This usually goes from bugs -> fish -> animals. I would eat bugs and fish because I don't think they feel much of anything. And at or near their end, I don't think they would be freaking out that much. Having said that, I wouldn't support torturing them (as I wouldn't support torturing livestock).

I am happy to eat bugs and fish because I view them much more like machines, acting on instinct. Not showing depression or anxiety when seperated from their young (like whales), and not showing showing signs of real intelligence (like the octopus).

Maybe a better line would be mammals vs not mammals? Are lizards and snakes empathetic and intelligent? Oh, birds and aligators surely are, so this line doesn't check out.

Maybe this line will move for me (from someone showing me evidence that there is more to fish), and I'll only be willing to eat insects. Maybe it'll move all the way to the left and I'll only be willing to eat plant-based protein. We'll see...

# Resources for vegan
- [Vegan Nutrition Guide](https://www.vegan.com/nutrition/)
  - Likely want to take a supplement for B12 and Vitamin D

# Cured meats at restaurants
Only eat cured/dried meats when eating out. Didn't like my experience recently of throwing away undercooked chicken from restaurant.

Might be worth saying only buy dried and frozen meats at store to only promote meats that are not throw away if not sold before expiration date.

# Seeds and fruit for breakfast
>Grains, beans, nuts and seeds are all in the same family as they are actually all seeds. Grains grow from the seeds of grasses, such as wheat, corn, oats or rice. Nuts, such as almonds, pecans, and walnuts, come from the seeds of a tree. And then there are the ones we refer to as seeds directly, such as sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds [that are found in fruits].
>
>All plants need assistance in dispersing their seeds as they are unable to move, so they need a way to create their own way of migrating, like growing delicious fruits around their seeds in order to entice animals, and humans, to eat them and carry them off to another location where the seeds are eventually spread.
>
>Grass seeds like wheat or corn do not have fruit. They rely mainly on the wind to disperse their seeds as they weren’t designed by nature to be eaten. Grains are actually toxic to humans in their raw state.
