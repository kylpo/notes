# What is it that makes people tick?
- Entertainment (privileged)
- Self improvement
- Competition (vs others, vs self)
- Power (for some)
- Escape (addicts, those with harder lives)

# Why get really good at something?
Think about:
- Gamers (best Tetris player, e-sports, best Black and White 2 player, best Chess player)
- Utility (building your house?)
- Money ($ valued skills)
- Fun
- Others?

# Why blog?
- some blog posts are a chore. Already thought it through, just need to put it to "paper".
- some blog posts are to explore a thought. Narrow my focus on a topic.
