# Aligning on systems, rules, patterns, and guides

I love aligning on systems, rules, patterns, guides to streamline decisions.

-------

I like to live by my own rules. Not to be read as "bad ass", instead, it is just a desire to limit creativity/questioning for the sake of productivity. This means I tend to wallow away at a very specific question until I have an answer that leaves me satisfied to mandate as a rule for myself going forward.

Example: coding best practices, aria role best practices, react project folder structure

-------

Best practices and Standards are such a relief. React, Flux, etc were just too open and intimidating for many people to get up and running quickly. Too many common problems, with too many potential solutions were around in the early days. Just like how Backbone allowed for too many different styles. Dan Abramov's work has brought a calming to React, much like Ruby on Rails brought a calming to web devs craving MVC back in the days.

Also, coding conventions and general good practices (container components, state vs props vs stores) are a bit more ironed out and can be read and summed up fairly quickly.

Now, there is a legitimate, well thought-through answer to almost every question of web dev with React (even animation). That was not the case a year ago...

---------

eslint is a perfect example of why self-configured, forced-governance leads to a less stressful life. As soon as I set up the style rules that made sure I couldn't think about how/why I should structure something a certain way, I was so relieved!

----------

Personal rules:
Only drink water, coffee, tea, or wine ?
Avoid high-carb food 6 days a week
Get 7 hours of sleep
Read a few pages a day
