# Flow
FLow to me is working asynchronously, with batching. It allows single focus and is the reason i dislike Slack as a communication medium. I'd much prefer deep work when I need it, then write mini-blog posts of my findings than having AHA! moments where I must show my co-workers immediately.

Instead of meeting in person, I need to be writing more.

"Cal Newport describes it as paradox in our work culture. It is a paradox, because technologies from nowadays are well suited to distract us. E-Mail, instant messengers and social media are used whenever we feel the slightest sign of boredom. Push notifications keep us distracted all the time."
