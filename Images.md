_WIP_

Images on the web are hard. Straight up. You need to make many decisions, it is so much more than "just throw an image in".

Starting with `<img />` vs `background-image` of a `<div />`

# Deferred vs Lazy Load
- Deferred will load every non-main image (usually below the fold) after page load
  - Necessary for those long, anchor-linked, single page sites
  - [Defer images without jQuery or lazy loading](https://varvy.com/pagespeed/defer-images.html)
    - ![](https://varvy.com/pagespeed/images/pageload.png)

- Lazy Load monitors scroll position to load in images based on their proximity to the viewport

# Perf
Even full loaded images can cause jank. When we had retina desktop images loaded on mobile, anchor scrolling and carousel scrolling were janky. Reducing image size was the fix.
