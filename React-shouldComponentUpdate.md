_WIP_

Did you know that you should never pure a comp with children? I certainly didn't before I did some digging. Join my on that adventure, then sick around for done other goodies if you'd like.

# Notes of shouldComponentUpdate
React's `shouldComponentUpdate` is one of our main tools for optimizing components. Below are the notes I've gathered on the not-obvious topic.

## tl;dr
- should be renamed to `shouldRerender()`
- keep stateful components shallow
- never `PureComponent` a component with children
- `cloneElement` of a `PureComponent` is tricky

- [Dan Abramov on Twitter: "PSA: React.PureComponent can make your app slower if you use it everywhere."](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/820668074223353858)
- React.PureComponent, shallowCompare
- stateless functional component can be pure, but it'll still rerender every time
- use primitives over objects/arrays, as http://ericlathrop.com/2017/02/why-did-this-react-component-rerender/ mentions
- scu => false will not prevent props from updating
  - actually a feature. Animate_'s `start*` to trigger animations without causing a rerender.
    - combines scu with cwrp. Advanced understanding to get here.

be sure to look through your [gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KfC1aoQbd9bAVXQGNNGm5-1hCG-P2TeX-vabaVZG6I8/edit)

CDM: child, then parent

reference https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/optimizing-performance.html

cSU == false
- still calls `willReceiveProps`

PureComponent re-rendering in Animate_
- children problem?
- animate() doing something to force re-render?
- I think it is a child mismatch problem
  - because child in render does not match what it returns?
- [Ives van Hoorne on Twitter: "Really good point by @angelpiscola, creating objects in render will also force a rerender for pure components, even if props didn't change. https://t.co/shKMYVOg1c"](https://twitter.com/Ives13/status/863129346592178178)

# Reduce re-renders by keeping stateful components shallow
Spawned from "One of the best tactics that you can apply early on is to try to keep components shallow. It will help you see which props components actually use and cut an extra re-render computation." - comment of https://marmelab.com/blog/2017/02/06/react-is-slow-react-is-fast.html

Would it be best to keep components as small as possible. No letting the depth increase by more than, say 3 components and height be no more than 3 sibling components?

That way a when a single component in a render needs to be updated, only a few other things will re-render, not many unrelated components.

How would this apply to Page level components?

"By removing the draft Tweet state from updating the main Redux state on every keypress and keeping things local in the React componentâ€™s state, we were able to reduce the overhead by over 50% (above, right)." - https://medium.com/@paularmstrong/twitter-lite-and-high-performance-react-progressive-web-apps-at-scale-d28a00e780a3

- "Ok, that make sense. The more depth your tree has the more time the diffing will take."

Connect components that are as deep in the tree as possible. Changes affect fewer components for updates. Vs changing something at the root.

## shouldComponentUpdate
Given this page, what do we expect to see in console?
```jsx
const Div = (props) => {
  console.log('Div Render');

  return (
    <div>{props.children}</div>
  )
}

export default class Home extends React.Component {
  state = {}

  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => this.setState({hi: 'hi'}), 2000)
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Div>{this.state.hi}</Div>
    )
  }
}
```
```bash
Div Render # initial mount

Div Render # after setState
```

Given this added code, what do we expect to see in console?
```jsx
class WrappingWontUpdate extends React.Component {
  shouldComponentUpdate() {
    return false
  }

  render() {
    console.log('WrappingWontUpdate Render');
    return this.props.children
  }
}

export default class Home extends React.Component {

  ...

  render() {
    return (
      <WrappingWontUpdate>
        <Div>{this.state.hi}</Div>
      </WrappingWontUpdate>
    )
  }
}
```
```bash
WrappingWontUpdate Render # initial mount
Div Render # initial mount

# nothing after setState
```

Makes sense, makes sense. Let's explore PureComponent.
```jsx
class PureComponentWrapper extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    console.log('PureComponentWrapper Render');
    return (
      <div>{this.props.children}</div>
    )
  }
}

export default class Home extends React.Component {

  ...

  render() {
    return (
      <PureComponentWrapper>
        <Div>{this.state.hi}</Div>
      </PureComponentWrapper>
    )
  }
}
```
```bash
PureComponentWrapper Render # initial mount
Div Render # initial mount

PureComponentWrapper Render # after setState
Div Render # after setState
```

Hmmm, we have a wrapping PureComponent, but still its update is run. Ah, this must be because the child is updated. So what happens when we try this render?
```jsx
<PureComponentWrapper>
  <WontUpdate />
</PureComponentWrapper>
```
```bash
PureComponentWrapper Render # initial mount
WontUpdate Render # initial mount

PureComponentWrapper Render # after setState
```

Uhhh, what? Why is a pureComponent re-rendering even when the child hasn't changed?

One more exploration:
```jsx
class PureComponentWithChildren extends React.PureComponent {

  render() {
    console.log('PureComponentWithChildren Render');

    return (
      <PureComponentWrapper>
        <Div />
      </PureComponentWrapper>
    )
  }
}

export default class Home extends React.Component {

  state = {}

  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => this.setState({hi: 'hi'}), 2000)
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <PureComponentWithChildren />
    )
  }
}
```
```bash
PureComponentWithChildren Render # initial mount
PureComponentWrapper Render # initial mount
Div Render # initial mount

# nothing after setState
```

Bummer, this means we can't benefit from `PureComponent` with children defined in a parent component.

# `cloneElement()` of a PureComponent child
Beware: when cloning a PureComponent, the same don't-pass-objects-or-arrays rule applies. The 2nd argument of the `cloneElement()` will always be an object, but no value of that object should be an object or array.
```jsx
class Cloning_ extends React.Component {
  render() {
    console.log('Cloning Render')

    const { children, ...propsToPass } = this.props
    const child = React.Children.only(children)

    console.log('passProps', propsToPass)

    return React.cloneElement(child, propsToPass)
  }
}

class PureComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    console.log('PureComponent Render')
    return (
      <div />
    )
  }
}

export default class App extends React.Component {
  state = {}

  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => this.setState({hi: 'hi'}), 2000)
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Cloning_ hi='hi'>
        <PureComponent />
      </Cloning_>
    )
  }
}

```
```bash
# first render
Cloning Render
passProps Object {hi: "hi"}
PureComponent Render

# after setState
Cloning Render
passProps Object {hi: "hi"}
# GOOD! missing PureComponent Render
```

Above is the desired effect. Below is what'll happen if `Cloning_` returns an object in an object: `React.cloneElement(child, {propsObject: propsToPass})`
```bash
# first render
Cloning Render
passProps Object {hi: "hi"}
PureComponent Render

# after setState
Cloning Render
passProps Object {hi: "hi"}
PureComponent Render # BAD!
```
